1-Final.lua
	Code generates MLP architecture used for MNIST in Torch 7. ITs written in LuaJIT and is WORKING code.
	Generation and Testing of NN and premise of the research. 
	Refer figure 5  of paper "Privacy Preserving Deep Learning"

3-dataset_MNIST.lua
	Helper file for MLP_MNIST_Arch2.lua. 
	Normalizes the MNIST dataset before it is used to train the NN in MLP_MNIST_Arch2.lua
	Source : https://github.com/torch/demos/blob/master/train-a-digit-classifier/dataset-mnist.lua
	Did not write this code.

4-cod.lua
